### Project Solution:


Completed Task 3, Task 4, Task 5.

Especially For Task 5: 
Created a Classical PyTorch Model (conspicuity-detection.ipynb) with 100% train and validation accuracy with an estimated model size of only 32.28Mb.

Using QML in Task 5 (qml-conspicuity-detection.ipynb):
I have added a quantum circuit layer to the output of "fc3" layer of the original classical model (see the conspicuity-detection.ipynb notebook) to see how adding an extra quantum circuit layer affects the model and trained it. 
I am unsure if it is properly working (executing the quantum circuit layer) (experts need to check it), even though it is giving some results.



All necessary code files and any additional information required to judge your project solution should be included in the repository.
